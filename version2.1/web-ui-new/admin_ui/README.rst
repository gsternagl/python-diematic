Diematic admin_ui
=================
A very simple user management system based on Flask-Admin and SQLAlchemy

You need the flask-libraries installed for that. For development I usually set them up in a virtualenv like this:

* virtualenv flask
* source flask/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt

 
To run it:

* ./run_admin_dev.py
